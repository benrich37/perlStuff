structure: POSCAR # Structure for optimization
fmax: 0.04 # Max force for convergence criteria
max_steps: 100 # Max number of steps before exit
gpu: True # Whether or not to use GPU (much faster)
restart: True # Whether to get structure from lat/opt dirs or from input structure
pbc: True True False # Periodic boundary conditions for unit cell
lattice steps: 0 # Number of steps for lattice optimization (0 = no lattice optimization)
opt program: jdft # Which program to use for ionic optimization, options are 'jdft' and 'ase'
freeze base: False # Whether to freeze lower atoms (don't use for bulk calcs)
freeze tol: 3. # Distance from topmost atom to impose freeze cutoff for freeze base
freeze count: 0 # freeze the lowest n atoms - overrides freeze tol if greater than 0pseudoset: GBRV # directory name containing pseudopotentials you wish to use (top directory must be assigned to 'JDFTx_pseudo' environmental variable)
bias: 0.00V # Bias relative to SHE (is only used if 'target-mu *' in inputs file
ddec6: True # Dump Elec Density and perform DDEC6 analysis on it
